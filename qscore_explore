'''
This function processes the output of samtools mpileup by splitting each line into a list with elements:
0. chromosome
1. position (a single nucleotide)
2. reference base at position
3. # of reads at position
4. "read bases": a string of characters describing the alignment at the position. Different notation
for matches, mismatches, indels, strand, mapping quality, and starts and ends of reads, not necessarily 1 char/read.
5. Base qualities, encoded as ASCII characters (1/ position).
6. Alignment mapping qualities, encoded as ASCII characters.

It accesses the 5th element to retrieve four mystical stones necessary to defend Earth from certain disas -
sorry no, it iterates through the string in [5] to convert ASCII base qualities into comma-separated numeric values.
